Your e-mail address will be used, at your request, to send you a copy of your user name and password.

We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.
<br />

We also allow access to our database by third parties that provide us with services, such as technical maintenance or forums and job search software, but only for the purpose of and to the extent necessary to provide those services. 
<br />
And if you choose to purchase items through features on the Website, we may forward your information to third parties for services such as credit card processing and order fulfillment. 
<br />
There are also times when you provide information about yourself to us in areas of the site that may be managed or participated in by third parties, such as auction services or shopping areas. 
<br />
In such cases, the information may be used by us and by such third party(ies), each pursuant to its own policies. 
<br />
We may also provide your information to our advertisers, so that they can serve ads to you that meet your needs or match your interests. 
<br />
While Service Provider will seek to require such third parties to follow appropriate privacy policies and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, Service Provider does not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of third parties. 
<br />

<b>Cookies</b>
<br />
<br />
<br />

You may have read about "cookies," pieces of information that are placed by a Website in a storage place on your own computer. 
<br />
We may use cookies to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the site, to deliver editorial content, and to record registration and personalization information. 
<br />
For example, if you register on any part of the Website and are given the option to save your user name and password on your computer, we can provide this convenience to you by placing a cookie on your computer. 
<br />
Our cookies may contain personally identifiable information and such cookies may be shared with our affiliates and other companies.

<br />
Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. 
<br />
We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.
<br />

We may also use advertising service vendors to help present advertisements on the Website.  
<br />
These vendors may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, these vendors may collect non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. 
<br />
The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these advertising service vendors is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours, and Service Provider disclaims all liability in connection therewith. 

<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Information Security and Notification</b>
<br />

<br />
In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. 
<br />
If notification is appropriate, we may notify you by e-mail (provided we have your e-mail address).
<br />
<br />

<br />
No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information or use our public discussion areas, forums and chats.
